# task_02

My name is Debneel Roy and this is day 2 of my SQL Developer Internship at Elevate Labs.

Today's task was to insert values into the tables, handle null and default values and write some update and delete queries on the tables

I have created two tables for today's task. Firstly, a Department table which has the following columns:

1. deptno-department number
2. deptname-department name
3. location

Secondly, an Employee table which has the following columns:

1. empno-employee number
2. empname-employee name
3. deptno-department name
4. salary
5. dob-date of birth
6. city

The SQL script is given in the repository.

Thank You.
